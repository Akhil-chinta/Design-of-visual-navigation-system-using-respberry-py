# Design-of-visual-navigation-system-using-respberry-py
A raspberry-based farmland tracked robot navigation system is designed. The system selects 2G-R-B graying factor to realize graying image, and uses median filtering, Otsu threshold segmentation and morphological processing to segment graying image from green plants and background. A convenient and relatively accurate central path extraction algorithm, and selection of region of interest are determined, which can greatly improve the real-time performance of the system. In the calculation of the navigation parameters, the lateral distance deviation between the calculated reference point and the navigation point is used to control the forward and steering operations of the robot. The design of visual navigation system of farmland tracked robot based on Raspberry Pie has good reliability, strong anti-interference ability and low cost, which will has wide application prospects and practical value for agricultural production.
